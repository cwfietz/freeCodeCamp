      <h2>A Word on the Recent Catnip Doping Scandal</h2>
      <p>
        The influence that catnip has on feline behavior is well-documented, and
        its use as an herbal supplement in competitive ninja circles remains
        controversial. Once again, the debate to ban the substance is brought to
        the public's attention after the high-profile win of Kittytron, a
        long-time proponent and user of the green stuff, at the Claw of Fury
        tournament.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I've stated in the past, I firmly believe a true ninja's skills must
        come from within, with no external influences. My own catnip use shall
        continue as purely recreational.
